## Open Source
I released Geomicons Wired over three years ago to great reception, and they’ve been used in many great-looking websites and apps since then.</p>

Over the past year, I’ve learned a lot from the open source community, and I’d like to give something back. Today I’m launching my third set,
[Geomicons Open](http://jxnblk.github.io/geomicons-open),
and yep, it’s open source. To coincide with the launch of Geomicons Open, I’ll also be offering Geomicons Wired for free (as in speech) through an open source license.

Anyone who’s purchased Geomicons Wired in the last three months should have gotten a refund from me by now. If you haven’t, please let me know. If you purchased the set before December 2013, I hope you’ve gotten at least $16 worth out of the set since then and can understand my decision to open source the set. That said, any past purchases of Geomicons Wired are now under the same open source license, which allows you to do a whole lot more with them.

Enjoy!
